The ext4 fs that was there is blown away, but the partition table was saved for reasons I don't want to go into. What are my options?

2016-03-24 23:12:03	MacGyver	sudokode: You're not forwarding packets back to the internet, and most routers should actually happily forward any and all traffic after applying ingress filtering.

2016-04-14 12:01:28	Samouy	Hello there, I am trying to install for my first time Arch Linux, so I followed the Beginner's page. Anyway I got an error with Grub-efi installation. My partitionning is one ESP (512MiB) and a dm-crypt/LUKS container with 2 LVMs volumes in it (rootfs and home). When I try to install the bootloader Grub in the ESP partition, I got stuck on boot with Grub, which can't find the grub.cfg file 
2016-04-14 12:01:44	Benzi-Junior	frenchbeard: hmm good question
2016-04-14 12:01:57	frenchbeard	x8b30cc: it depends if you are used to vim, otherwise you may wanna check the other provided options

2016-05-12 10:26:10	grawity	1) don't use sed at all; just append
2016-05-12 10:26:28	grawity	2) look into the 'i' and 'a' commands
2016-05-12 10:26:41	grawity	3) don't sed all options at once, but one by one, in case they've been reordered or already uncommented
2016-05-12 10:26:49	jasonwryan	and just remove the comments from the options you want
2016-05-12 10:26:57	grawity	/UseSyslog/ s/^#//

2016-05-12 10:27:11	Kirito	I don't really understand the TERM environment variable
2016-05-12 10:27:30	grawity	/^\[options\]/aILoveCandy
2016-05-12 10:27:39	Kirito	It's just "that variable that you need to export as xterm-256color to get 256 colors to work properly, but you shouldn't actually override this"
2016-05-12 10:27:48	jasonwryan	the key thing, Kirito, is not to fuck with it
2016-05-12 10:28:07	grawity	Kirito: more like "append -256color to the existing value, if not already present"

2016-05-12 10:28:26	Kirito	grawity, well that would avoid the problem I'm having now I guess >_>
2016-05-12 10:28:50	grawity	if [[ $TERM == @(xterm|rxvt-unicode|screen|tmux) ]]; then TERM=$TERM-256color; fi
2016-05-12 10:28:53	Kirito	or not
2016-05-12 10:29:03	Magnetz74	Thank you grawity

2016-05-12 10:29:48	Kirito	thank you
2016-05-12 10:30:05	Magnetz74	Normally I would do one option at a time, but "ILoveCandy" has to be under # Misc Options in this case
2016-05-12 10:30:21	Kirito	vim was showing the error for about 2 seconds before opening so I was just going off it at a glance >_>
2016-05-12 10:30:37	grawity	Magnetz74: it doesn't
2016-05-12 10:30:55	grawity	though you could /# Misc/aILoveCandy in that case
2016-05-12 10:31:01	-->	denisk has joined #archlinux
2016-05-12 10:31:53	Magnetz74	grawity: Yes, it does "warning: config file /etc/pacman.conf, line 109: directive 'ILoveCandy' in section 'pipelight' not recognized."
2016-05-12 10:32:00	Iridos	what's the @(x|y|z) doing there? effin magnets, how do they work
2016-05-12 10:32:09	-->	t_h has joined #archlinux
2016-05-12 10:32:11	Magnetz74	If I put it under options it works
2016-05-12 10:32:21	grawity	Magnetz74: that's because it has to be under [options]
2016-05-12 10:32:34	grawity	not specifically under "# Misc" but somewhere under [options]
2016-05-12 10:32:50	Iridos	oh, sub-patterns. never seen that...
