2016-05-01 20:55:22	TheSinding	seem*
2016-05-01 20:55:54	TheSinding	I tried looking through the arch wiki
2016-05-01 20:56:03	&Caleb	TheSinding, ok if you want the help you need i strongly suggest joining archlinux on freenode
2016-05-01 20:56:10	&Caleb	are you following the wiki?
2016-05-01 20:56:16	TheSinding	I could do that..
2016-05-01 20:56:18	&Caleb	because you follow it not skim it

2016-05-01 20:57:44	TheSinding	Stuck at the UEFI part
2016-05-01 20:57:56	&Caleb	look into grub2 i think
2016-05-01 20:58:08	&Caleb	make sure youre using the right boot loader for uefi
2016-05-01 20:58:56	TheSinding	Like grub?

2016-05-01 21:00:59	TheSinding	I just cant install grub correctly thats the problem
2016-05-01 21:01:57	Anubis169	nngh, uefi's caused nothing but trouble since it came in :/
2016-05-01 21:02:44	TheSinding	What is the good thing about UEFI ? .. I could go back too legacy

2016-05-01 21:53:25	dinkster	hm not really
2016-05-01 21:53:31	dinkster	it sucessfully added it
2016-05-01 21:54:50	dinkster	says it should work fine in ubuntu based distros
2016-05-01 21:54:58	dinkster	but ubuntu is debian based
