2016-03-24 22:04:48	thesinding	Hey guys..
2016-03-24 22:04:53	thesinding	How are we today? 
2016-03-24 22:04:53	&Leliana	Hi thesinding
2016-03-24 22:05:01	&Leliana	[memes internally]
2016-03-24 22:05:16	thesinding	Memes? ^^
2016-03-24 22:05:28	&Leliana	[memes intensify]
2016-03-24 22:05:39	homu	lunarmage: it should be exactly the same as setting nginx up for php-cgi
2016-03-24 22:05:53	homu	or php-fastcgi or whatever it was called
2016-03-24 22:05:59	thesinding	[memes is intense]
2016-03-24 22:06:05	&lunarmage	I have no idea hot to set it up for any php
2016-03-24 22:06:15	&Leliana	lunarmage: just use nginx
2016-03-24 22:06:19	&lunarmage	and then I have to set up SSL and I have no idea how SSL even works
2016-03-24 22:06:42	homu	https://www.linode.com/docs/websites/nginx/nginx-and-phpfastcgi-on-ubuntu-10-04-lts-lucid/
2016-03-24 22:06:44	+Aigis	URL: Nginx and PHP-FastCGI on Ubuntu 10.04 LTS (Lucid)
2016-03-24 22:06:45	homu	basically like this
2016-03-24 22:06:46	&lunarmage	so I installed lighttpd, added my shit and it worked
2016-03-24 22:06:50	thesinding	You have to have a key for ssl
2016-03-24 22:06:51	thesinding	:S
2016-03-24 22:06:52	&lunarmage	for five minutes
2016-03-24 22:06:59	&lunarmage	and then it stopped working for no reason
2016-03-24 22:07:01	mieko	lunarmage: do you want one of my nginx config files? :I
2016-03-24 22:07:15	homu	and if you want SSL, use settings like these https://github.com/homura/misc/blob/master/nginx.conf
2016-03-24 22:07:17	+Aigis	URL: misc/nginx.conf at master ? homura/misc ? GitHub
2016-03-24 22:07:30	&lunarmage	yeah that's the thing I'm already too lost and have no idea what I'm doing and am also confused with my surroundings
2016-03-24 22:07:30	rdr	Lynn <3
2016-03-24 22:07:39	&lunarmage	I think I need to reinstall
2016-03-24 22:07:45	&lunarmage	like, reinstall my OS
2016-03-24 22:07:53	mieko	#windowslife
2016-03-24 22:07:55	@Lynn	rdr: ^.^
2016-03-24 22:07:56	homu	uh-oh
2016-03-24 22:08:03	cypherpunk	and does taytweets speak in memes because of the general data it mined or because some people from the chins targeted it somehow?
2016-03-24 22:08:04	&lunarmage	for fresh config files
2016-03-24 22:08:13	homu	what OS is it?
2016-03-24 22:08:17	&lunarmage	ubuntu
2016-03-24 22:08:18	&Leliana	mieko: why support DES-CBC3-SHA at all?
2016-03-24 22:08:25	homu	apt-get purge lighttpd
2016-03-24 22:08:27	mieko	mikel: pomf?
2016-03-24 22:08:31	mieko	Leliana: pomf?
2016-03-24 22:08:34	rdr	pomf =3
2016-03-24 22:08:35	apt-get	ahue
2016-03-24 22:08:38	rdr	what are we going to do in the bed
2016-03-24 22:08:39	&lunarmage	cypherpunk: afaik it was multiple memers doing that
2016-03-24 22:08:49	&Leliana	it's a weak cipher and you're not losing anything by disabling it considering the only things that require it are broken by SNI anyway
2016-03-24 22:08:59	mieko	I dont think I have it enabled tho
2016-03-24 22:09:05	&Leliana	you do
2016-03-24 22:09:08	mieko	where?
2016-03-24 22:09:10	&Leliana	it's in your cipher list fma
2016-03-24 22:09:16	&Leliana	that you just linked
2016-03-24 22:09:21	mieko	I didnt link anything
2016-03-24 22:09:28	&lunarmage	ok it throws error 500 on one file
2016-03-24 22:09:35	&lunarmage	I probably should've checked that earlier lmao
2016-03-24 22:09:39	&Leliana	oh fuck
2016-03-24 22:09:43	&Leliana	homu: ^
2016-03-24 22:09:45	&lunarmage	so it's a problem with that file in particular
2016-03-24 22:09:48	&Leliana	I need to read more
2016-03-24 22:09:55	homu	hmmmm
2016-03-24 22:09:55	mieko	Leliana: I use

2016-03-24 22:10:20	mieko	so I guess it's alright
2016-03-24 22:10:29	&lunarmage	is this your google password

2016-03-24 22:12:19	homu	but microsoft skipped windows 9
2016-03-24 22:12:19	thesinding	mieko: What do you use instead of google ? Mail wise.. 
2016-03-24 22:12:50	mieko	thesinding: I got my own mailserver, an emailaddress from the irc network where I'm staff and an @national.shitposting.agency
2016-03-24 22:12:55	mieko	but mostly my own mailserver
2016-03-24 22:13:22	homu	i need to learn to run mail servers
2016-03-24 22:13:22	&Leliana	>guys here's an AI experiment to see how one learns from natural language
2016-03-24 22:13:29	&Leliana	>oh btw we're censoring anything not PC xD
2016-03-24 22:13:32	mieko	setting up a mailserver is a pain
2016-03-24 22:13:42	&Leliana	mieko: A E S T H E T I C S
2016-03-24 22:13:45	mieko	homu: dont do it unless you really have a sane usecase for it
2016-03-24 22:13:48	thesinding	Okay cool.. Yeah it really is a pain
2016-03-24 22:14:10	mieko	like, next time I'll just use some prefab configs instead of trying to tweak everything  myself
2016-03-24 22:14:12	homu	well, i don't like the butt computing meme, and i'd rather have my mail local
2016-03-24 22:14:31	Enzyme	butt computing?

2016-03-24 22:15:57	&Leliana	To me, using cock.li is the same as using a joke license for software
2016-03-24 22:16:02	&Leliana	eventually, it will come back to bite you

2016-03-24 22:39:09	&Leliana	you'd hit a point where the server would choke on performance before it ever got closed to 40GB
2016-03-24 22:39:15	homu	oh it did
2016-03-24 22:39:19	Enzyme	I'm unsure I'd believe it using 40GB, I'd believe it maxing out a Xeon forever tho.
2016-03-24 22:39:25	&Leliana	because a single minecraft server instance is not able to handle that many players
2016-03-24 22:39:30	&Leliana	which is why bungeecord exists

2016-03-24 23:08:21	+DANtheBEASTman	list comprehensions are nice tho. if I did lua more I'd think about it
2016-03-24 23:08:33	+DANtheBEASTman	i wish js had list comprehensions
2016-03-24 23:09:01	thesinding	DANtheBEASTman: I just dont like how you are required to use the whitespace all the time, and i dont like the look of it aswell
2016-03-24 23:09:03	arianon	IIRC moonscript takes expressivity to quite some extremes, and comparing it to coffeescript, that's saying something, eh.
2016-03-24 23:09:30	thesinding	I dont like LUA that much either for that matter.

2016-03-24 23:10:35	+DANtheBEASTman	yeah i don't like coffeescript either. i'd rather write just plain js
2016-03-24 23:11:00	arianon	if i were to have a layer of abstraction over JS, i'd use typescript
2016-03-24 23:11:18	arianon	or purescript if im feeling both adventurous and retaking my odyssey unto functional programming

2016-04-06 00:50:11	mieko	gentoo has the latest and greatest before funtoo, but you could create a guntoo by using the official gentoo repos as overlay for your funtoo
2016-04-06 00:50:20	+DANtheBEASTman	thesinding: it should. i don't mess with gtk themes because I don't really care about colors and such, but if you look through any gtk theme there's always files for certain programs, I don't see why you couldn't make one for nm-applet

2016-04-06 00:50:26	LeDZeP	:^)
2016-04-06 00:50:26	mieko	but funtoo has the latest  and greatest gentoo-specific features
2016-04-06 00:50:32	mieko	ironically enough
2016-04-06 00:50:41	%kyubiko	Install from that whilst ircing on your existing installation
2016-04-06 00:51:03	LeDZeP	mieko: that makes no sense
2016-04-06 00:51:06	LeDZeP	kyubiko: literally how
2016-04-06 00:51:19	LeDZeP	can you actually install onto a partition from another one without having to turn your computer off
2016-04-06 00:51:22	LeDZeP	that sounds fucking weird
2016-04-06 00:51:32	metredigm	X really hates being started twice from the same VT
2016-04-06 00:51:41	mieko	LeDZeP: the original creator of gentoo dropped gentoo and went on with funtoo, he still develops and releases stuff there, and gentoo takes those changes back into their own repos
2016-04-06 00:51:43	LeDZeP	also what if I break it mieko

2016-04-08 00:53:28	+Aigis	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7273601/is-there-a-vim-plugin-for-highlighting-hex-rgb-colors - You mean like this plugin: css_color ?

2016-04-08 00:53:45	+Aigis	https://github.com/chrisbra/Colorizer - It works best in the gui version of Vim, but the plugin also supports 256 and 88 color terminals and translates the colors to those supported by the terminal.

2016-04-12 01:01:28	Forkk	if it's saying you have no free space, it's probably not counting /mnt towards that

2016-04-12 20:44:39	volsa-	It kinda sounds scary with those "reality checks"
2016-04-12 20:44:43	volsa-	but you know
2016-04-12 20:44:57	volsa-	I could program in my dreams
2016-04-12 20:44:58	TheSinding	Its pretty cool
2016-04-12 20:45:00	volsa-	and control them
2016-04-12 20:45:18	volsa-	did you do reality checks?
2016-04-12 20:45:58	TheSinding	Not really, i had one of thoes moments in the dream, when I discovered that it was a dream..
2016-04-12 20:46:27	TheSinding	I think it was that the gokart i was riding was suddenly flying.
2016-04-12 20:48:14	TheSinding	You are thinking about, the things people do, to check if its a dream right ? 
2016-04-12 20:48:30	volsa-	No
2016-04-12 20:48:36	TheSinding	That knocking on a sink three times, or the light switch thing
2016-04-12 20:48:49	TheSinding	Some people do that
2016-04-12 20:48:50	volsa-	you count your fingers in some sort of hard motion
2016-04-12 20:49:02	volsa-	and in dreams your brain somehow doesnt realize you have 5 fingers on each hand
2016-04-12 20:49:05	TheSinding	Oh, I dont know anything about that
2016-04-12 20:49:10	volsa-	so it sometimes gives your 4 or 6 fingers
2016-04-12 20:49:18	TheSinding	Arh okay.
2016-04-12 20:49:31	TheSinding	No never "looked" at my hand 
2016-04-12 20:49:32	volsa-	and should it be 5 in dreams, then there's the weird motion which is apparently very hard to do in dreams
2016-04-12 20:50:05	volsa-	but yea switching on the light also works
2016-04-12 20:50:11	volsa-	although not always as some people say
2016-04-12 20:50:45	TheSinding	True.. There is also all sorts of hurbs you can try if you want
2016-04-12 20:50:57	TheSinding	Havent tried it myself
2016-04-12 20:51:24	volsa-	well
2016-04-12 20:51:31	volsa-	I will give it a shot somewhen
2016-04-12 20:51:55	volsa-	but the thought of not knowing if you're dreaming right now or if its reality is kinda scary
2016-04-12 20:52:19	TheSinding	Yeah !.. 
2016-04-12 20:52:35	TheSinding	have you tried sleep parallsys?

2016-04-12 20:54:27	skr0tm	dont try sleep paralysis
2016-04-12 20:54:43	TheSinding	Thats when the body somehow "goes to sleep" and like some of the brain is aswell, but you have your eyes open
2016-04-12 20:54:58	TheSinding	and you start "dreaming", when you are awake
2016-04-12 20:55:04	skr0tm	and you cant move, and its the most terrefying thing ever
2016-04-12 20:55:11	TheSinding	and see and hear all sorts of sound
2016-04-12 20:55:12	TheSinding	yeah

2016-04-12 20:55:56	skr0tm	you just do at one point
2016-04-12 20:56:05	TheSinding	I usally tries to "move" my body really hard
2016-04-12 20:56:08	yuiop	you can force it too
2016-04-12 20:56:10	TheSinding	try
2016-04-12 20:56:27	TheSinding	then its like you slowly wakes up
2016-04-12 20:56:38	yuiop	i tend to attempt turning my head, which usually works
2016-04-12 20:56:46	TheSinding	Yeah.. That too
2016-04-12 20:57:03	volsa-	but whats the point of that?

2016-04-12 20:57:45	TheSinding	Thats awful
2016-04-12 20:57:51	yuiop	doctor says it's cause of stress and lack of sleep

2016-04-14 12:41:51	+codedwrench	morning rice
2016-04-14 12:42:18	antona	does c.execute('select * from quotes order by random();') return a random quote every time if you run it?

2016-04-14 12:43:21	+codedwrench	antona, doesn't that return all quotes in a random order ...
2016-04-14 12:43:59	antona	codedwrench: 
2016-04-14 12:44:05	antona	codedwrench: yes but he runs fetchone

2016-04-14 12:44:12	yuppie	antona 
2016-04-14 12:44:12	yuppie	what
2016-04-14 12:44:15	+codedwrench	ah
2016-04-14 12:44:39	antona	I just dont know how the index function works
2016-04-14 12:45:01	antona	yuppie: do you get the same quote every time you reload / open the page?
2016-04-14 12:45:27	TheSinding	Any idea why it does this ? https://ptpb.pw/ax4U
2016-04-14 12:45:52	TheSinding	Everything seems right but chrome (which is gtk right ? )
2016-04-14 12:46:20	+codedwrench	it's gtk but the theme on chrome is pretty much always fucked up
2016-04-14 12:46:29	antona	^
2016-04-14 12:46:42	+codedwrench	i think you can change the interface font somewhere in the settings 
2016-04-14 12:47:19	TheSinding	Chrome is "zoomed" 
2016-04-14 12:47:29	TheSinding	Thats what im talking about
2016-04-14 12:47:42	TheSinding	Or is it the same yuo are talking about ? 
2016-04-14 12:47:46	yuppie	antona yes i get the same quote every time
2016-04-14 12:47:53	yuppie	because i think the thing is only run once
2016-04-14 12:48:04	 *	Cosumu throws yuppie into the fun pit
2016-04-14 12:48:05	antona	well shouldnt it?
2016-04-14 12:48:15	yuppie	its should run each time the page is reloaded
2016-04-14 12:48:16	+codedwrench	yuppie, you should have it fetch the next one 
2016-04-14 12:48:27	yuppie	codedwrench a random one, each refresh
2016-04-14 12:48:41	antona	I just dont know how the index() works
2016-04-14 12:48:50	+codedwrench	yeah but the command antona suggested gives you a whole list of random ones
2016-04-14 12:48:52	antona	is it called on refresh or not
2016-04-14 12:49:07	yuppie	no its not called
2016-04-14 12:49:09	Khorne	yes
2016-04-14 12:49:13	antona	codewrench, he runs random() and then fetchone
2016-04-14 12:49:33	+codedwrench	yeah, but afaik you can then just have it fetch the next one
2016-04-14 12:49:39	+codedwrench	ofc the list is finite tho 
2016-04-14 12:49:39	antona	yuppie: well can you use if __name__ == "__main__": ?
2016-04-14 12:49:54	antona	oh
2016-04-14 12:49:55	yuppie	antona what? im a newb, tell me where to put that
2016-04-14 12:49:57	antona	it doesnt run sorry
2016-04-14 12:49:59	antona	nvm
2016-04-14 12:50:28	antona	isnt there just a "onReload()" f.ex. in flask?
2016-04-14 12:50:37	yuppie	is there?
2016-04-14 12:50:38	Khorne	yuppie, your quotes variable doesnt ever change
2016-04-14 12:50:40	+codedwrench	also TheSinding if you change the interface font it should look less zoomed, also what's your res
2016-04-14 12:50:46	Khorne	make quotes=quotes()
2016-04-14 12:50:56	+codedwrench	nosquint fixes the page zoom

2016-04-14 12:51:12	Khorne	or get quotes=get_quote()
2016-04-14 12:51:19	Khorne	Where get_quote() fetches a new quote
2016-04-14 12:51:21	+codedwrench	chrome does not listen to dpi scaling iirc

2016-04-14 12:53:06	Khorne	quotes=get_quote()) where get_quote() is a function that fetches a quote
2016-04-14 12:53:17	Khorne	Should work then
2016-04-14 12:53:26	yuppie	Khorne sounds like i need to make select_quotes into a function or something

2016-04-14 13:56:25	antona	Khorne: yes, but the if __name__ == "__main__" clause should only run the module you start off with
2016-04-14 13:56:37	antona	__name__ from the external module is never main
2016-04-14 13:56:40	skr0tm	if you really want to share your rice you get it out to more people using .dtop at 3am than posting on unixart
2016-04-14 13:56:41	antona	am I not right?
2016-04-14 13:56:49	antona	It's more of a question :)

2016-04-15 00:05:43	lpf	rice milk pretty good
2016-04-15 00:06:07	Milkman	heh, there are people that hate soy milk because its too thick and reminds them of other things
2016-04-15 00:06:30	Milkman	cereal soy milk is really good
2016-04-15 00:06:34	Milkman	specially with integral cereals
2016-04-15 00:07:20	Milkman	i haven't tried rice milk het
2016-04-15 00:07:21	Milkman	yet*
2016-04-15 00:07:56	Milkman	the big problem with soy milk is vegetal hormones

2016-04-15 00:09:20	Milkman	agreed
2016-04-15 00:09:24	eric_	lpf: what if men drink it
2016-04-15 00:09:25	Milkman	flat is status
2016-04-15 00:10:00	Milkman	but they also make you more sensible to emotions and effeminate
2016-04-15 00:10:10	eric_	I MUST DRINK ALL THE MILK
2016-04-15 00:10:11	mobo	horrible
2016-04-15 00:10:45	Milkman	it seems to depend on the quantity, are people that notice nothing and others who start having symptoms after 300 or 400ml per day
2016-04-15 00:11:27	Milkman	that was the daily milk man for you

2016-04-15 00:13:49	eric_	think about all the bad food you can eat without those extra calories
2016-04-15 00:15:49	Milkman	maybe it goes like this: not having breakfast -> hungry for dinner -> sleep after dinner -> not burning calories -> not hungry in the morning

2016-04-17 19:48:15	m4nuuu	Know of? Or know how to use?
2016-04-17 19:48:28	c0re	too little... just some markup, some bash, currently aiming to learn python 
2016-04-17 19:50:21	TheSinding	Some: C++, PHP, NodeJS.. Little: Python, Lua, C#
2016-04-17 19:50:41	cosarara	C, C++, python, lua, PHP, some common lisp, rust, some java
2016-04-17 19:51:25	TheSinding	Forgot java
2016-04-17 19:52:01	+neeasade	man gtk is gross
2016-04-17 19:52:18	oedla	volsa-: only know Pascal (lmao) tbh, completely worthless
2016-04-17 19:52:24	oedla	so yeah, one
2016-04-17 19:52:33	oedla	I suck at coding in general though, so no matter
2016-04-17 19:53:09	cosarara	it's not completely worthless
2016-04-17 19:53:30	cosarara	if you were capable of learning one language, it'll be easy to pick another one from the same family
2016-04-17 19:53:39	cosarara	and you can solve problems with pascal just fine
2016-04-17 19:53:44	oedla	true, but I also haven't touched anyting in regards to it in 10 years, so saying that I know it might be a stretch as well
2016-04-17 19:54:14	oedla	Anyway, it was what we used for 3 years when I took programming in High School
2016-04-17 19:54:52	oedla	Dunno why we didn't do C or C++ or something, but there it is.
2016-04-17 19:57:03	volsa-	alright
2016-04-17 19:57:06	volsa-	pretty interesting
2016-04-17 19:57:06	cosarara	probably because the professor knew pascal better
2016-04-17 19:57:14	volsa-	idk if I should learn python or c++ after java though
2016-04-17 19:57:27	volsa-	python looks pretty neat for quick solutions and hobby shit
2016-04-17 19:57:32	volsa-	but c++ also looks nice
2016-04-17 19:57:55	cosarara	C++ is not nice. It's useful and important, but not nice
2016-04-17 19:58:16	volsa-	well
2016-04-17 19:58:21	volsa-	lets say its interesting
2016-04-17 19:58:35	volsa-	I like how you have to do all the shit yourself compared to java
2016-04-17 19:59:31	oedla	python is actually a great starting point to learn how to "think" in terms of coding, if nothing else
2016-04-17 19:59:34	oedla	very graspable
2016-04-17 19:59:48	oedla	IMO at last
2016-04-17 19:59:58	oedla	but like I said, I don't know shit really xD
2016-04-17 20:00:37	volsa-	well I actually already know how to code (mostly java) but idk what to learn after java
2016-04-17 20:00:48	volsa-	but why don't you start with python?
2016-04-17 20:01:33	oedla	I did, it was part of the coursework in college, mainly for networking scripts and the like
2016-04-17 20:01:48	oedla	for me, it's mostly that I don't find it interesting, hard to learn and git gud when you don't care
2016-04-17 20:03:37	oedla	Kinda hate tech in general these days, working my ass off ATM to get out of the industry as a matter of fact. Would be so fucking nice to be a normalfag who calls the help desk whenever something goes wrong
2016-04-17 20:03:43	oedla	Not really, but still, I want off this ride.
2016-04-17 20:04:13	volsa-	kek
2016-04-17 20:04:41	volsa-	yet youre ricing on linux even though you hate "tech in general"
2016-04-17 20:05:05	oedla	I guess I see it more as design, really.
2016-04-17 20:05:17	oedla	As for linux, I use it because it's what I'm comfy with.
2016-04-17 20:05:43	oedla	It used to be a great hobby, then I chose to make it my job and now I hate it. it's not unheard of
2016-04-17 20:06:00	oedla	maybe I'd feel differently if I could have it as just my hobby again

2016-04-17 20:23:02	oedla	Cop, hence entrance tests. Fat cops aren't a thing here so you need to be moderately /fit/ to get in.
2016-04-17 20:23:31	oedla	I always wanted to be one, but never thought I could do it
2016-04-17 20:24:02	oedla	but now I've lost 139lbs and shit, so maybe I can, gonna try at least.
2016-04-17 20:24:06	oedla	Follow that dream etc
2016-04-17 20:24:15	m4nuuu	Do it
2016-04-17 20:25:32	oedla	yeh, pretty stoked about it... which is a problem, since if I don't get in I'll get depressed as fuck (which probably means I'll get fat as fuck again, lmao)
2016-04-17 20:25:35	oedla	we'll see though

2016-04-17 20:29:00	oedla	Of course, I would be happy with whatever then I guess, but you have to do something in life, right?
2016-04-17 20:29:33	m4nuuu	I'm definatly the wrong person to ask, I tend to do things as the seem like a good idea at the time. My state of mind isn't really impacted by whether I do it or not.

2016-04-17 23:16:45	%DANtheBEASTman	fullsalvo: compared to vim, i'd say so. the fact that you need plugins to load in a specific order really fucks me up. the fact that your emacs configs suffer from 'bankruptcy' is telling

2016-04-17 23:22:08	EpSoldier	what does "emacs config bankruptcy" mean?
2016-04-17 23:22:15	EpSoldier	does it steal all your money?
2016-04-17 23:22:37	+neeasade	EpSoldier: technical debt/more maintenence of your config than vim is what I think DANtheBEASTman is hitting on.
2016-04-17 23:22:57	EpSoldier	ah
2016-04-17 23:23:32	%DANtheBEASTman	iinm, people hit emacs bankruptcy when suddenly their config breaks and it's more trouble to figure out how it broke than to start over
2016-04-17 23:23:32	fullsalvo	Each text editor has its good and bad traits
2016-04-17 23:23:39	fullsalvo	everyone just needs to find whatever works for them
2016-04-17 23:23:51	EpSoldier	vim is fine <3
2016-04-17 23:24:08	%DANtheBEASTman	for sure. i'd say emacs is unarguably more powerful than vim, but the complexity is a huge trade-off

2016-04-17 23:40:16	+neeasade	fullsalvo: ah gotcha

2016-04-19 21:06:04	Forkk	but it can send and receive messages, they're logged to disk, and the core can read the logs back
2016-04-19 21:06:17	Forkk	and the client can load them from the core

2016-04-19 22:05:37	%DANtheBEASTman	surreal: well other languages are used a lot more for other things, viml is very niche, so you have to rely on the official docs, there's not a lot to be found elsewhere (besides steve losch's excellent learn viml the hard way)
2016-04-19 22:06:02	surreal	vim is absolute shit for everything i can't get it to do any of the things i want, therefore fuck it

2016-04-20 01:27:53	%DANtheBEASTman	idk i just scrolled through and saw lots of weird glyphs
2016-04-20 01:29:07	TheSinding	Haha, yeah.. Well, eh it works so.. Dont wanna change it or rewrite it right now.
2016-04-20 01:31:02	%DANtheBEASTman	one of fav reasons to use awesome's wibar is the fact you can use actual icons in it.. well, that and easy mouse events
2016-04-20 01:31:37	TheSinding	Yeah, but havent tried it yet.. How is it with scaling the icons then ? 
2016-04-20 01:32:27	%DANtheBEASTman	!tias

2016-04-20 01:33:04	TheSinding	Haha.. Okay okay.
2016-04-20 01:34:23	TheSinding	Hey I kinda like shifty..
2016-04-20 01:35:08	%DANtheBEASTman	ya it's sweet. i like that it cuts down on the empty tag clutter
2016-04-20 01:35:27	TheSinding	Yeah.
2016-04-20 01:36:44	%DANtheBEASTman	there's eminent, which kinda does the same thing but it requires a bit more manual intervention for my liking, shifty just werkz

2016-04-20 01:38:53	TheSinding	Arh
2016-04-20 01:38:59	TheSinding	It tries to be simple
2016-04-20 01:40:05	TheSinding	Actually it aims to be so simple, you dont have to change the rc.lua 
2016-04-20 01:42:38	%DANtheBEASTman	try em both, see which you like. i ended up liking shifty a lot more, maybe you like eminent. commit your changes, make a new branch, try out eminent
2016-04-20 01:42:59	TheSinding	Great idea.
2016-04-20 01:43:22	%DANtheBEASTman	it's the best part about using git with your dots

2016-04-20 01:49:34	@Tomoko_A_Best	but hard to get used to
2016-04-20 01:49:37	@Tomoko_A_Best	I'll pass
2016-04-20 01:49:47	TheSinding	Do you know why powerline does this ? I tried googling it 
2016-04-20 01:49:48	TheSinding	https://ptpb.pw/WDZ0
2016-04-20 01:50:06	@Tomoko_A_Best	I've seen that happen to a few people
2016-04-20 01:50:37	%DANtheBEASTman	Tomoko_A_Best: it's really not all that hard to get used to.. just takes a bit of perseverence.
2016-04-20 01:50:43	@Tomoko_A_Best	you might need a powerline compatable font or something
2016-04-20 01:50:45	%DANtheBEASTman	TheSinding: idk. maybe don't use bloated bs
2016-04-20 01:50:47	@Tomoko_A_Best	it's never happened to me
2016-04-20 01:50:54	@Tomoko_A_Best	>vim
2016-04-20 01:50:56	@Tomoko_A_Best	>bloated
2016-04-20 01:51:04	%DANtheBEASTman	no, powerline is bloat
2016-04-20 01:51:11	%DANtheBEASTman	airline is much better
2016-04-20 01:51:21	TheSinding	Airline? Gonna check that out
2016-04-20 01:51:37	%DANtheBEASTman	also try lightline
2016-04-20 01:51:43	@Tomoko_A_Best	powerline is not bloat
2016-04-20 01:51:48	@Tomoko_A_Best	powerline is very handy
2016-04-20 01:51:58	@Tomoko_A_Best	and I don't see any bloat
2016-04-20 01:52:20	TheSinding	Airline does the same as powerline ? 
2016-04-20 01:52:28	%DANtheBEASTman	they all do roughly the same thing
2016-04-20 01:52:44	%DANtheBEASTman	powerline is a bunch of python bullshit which has no business in my vim
2016-04-20 01:52:54	%DANtheBEASTman	airline is pure vimscript
2016-04-20 01:53:19	%DANtheBEASTman	not that vimscript is a great language by any means, but that the overhead compared to powerline is non-existant
2016-04-20 01:53:28	TheSinding	Do you have something for the shell and tmux then ? 
2016-04-20 01:54:00	%DANtheBEASTman	i use agnoster for omz, and i just custom-wrote my tmux.conf, it's cake
2016-04-20 01:54:04	%DANtheBEASTman	*from omz
2016-04-20 01:55:44	+LambdaComplex	DANtheBEASTman: quick, gimme some awesome tmux features that i don't know about
2016-04-20 01:56:12	%DANtheBEASTman	LambdaComplex: tmux-copycat
2016-04-20 01:56:27	%DANtheBEASTman	i type C-a C-u and it automatially highlights the first url it finds.
2016-04-20 01:56:51	%DANtheBEASTman	granted that's not a native tmux feature, but it's a feature for tmux nontheless
2016-04-20 01:57:19	+LambdaComplex	sounds neat
2016-04-20 01:57:23	+LambdaComplex	gimme some more
2016-04-20 01:57:42	%DANtheBEASTman	it also works with file paths
2016-04-20 01:57:57	%DANtheBEASTman	uhm. you want reasons to use tmux in general?
2016-04-20 01:58:22	+LambdaComplex	i mean, obviously there's the splitting
2016-04-20 01:58:35	+LambdaComplex	and windows
2016-04-20 02:00:20	%DANtheBEASTman	splitting and joining and panes/windows. nested tmux sessions are slighy confusing but also really nice and give a you a sort of IDE feel in your terminal, for example i have vim running in a pane, then below i run a nested session, and i'll run background jobs in one pane, then i can make a new split/window run another command. vim+tmux lets me run a repl in another pane and send lines from vim
2016-04-20 02:00:21	%DANtheBEASTman	to the repl
2016-04-20 02:01:14	%DANtheBEASTman	so while i'm working on a node project, i might have a node repl in one nested pane, and a build/watch script in another
2016-04-20 02:01:25	+LambdaComplex	what's the point of nesting tmux sessions in that example?
2016-04-20 02:02:04	%DANtheBEASTman	it lets me have a 'main' pane up top, and then another pane below that i can switch windows with and still keep vim visible
2016-04-20 02:02:33	%DANtheBEASTman	i g2g, bbl
2016-04-20 02:03:34	+LambdaComplex	oh okay

2016-04-26 23:23:39	%DANtheBEASTman	no, they're duncan designed. as in, licensed knock-offs
2016-04-26 23:23:57	&Leliana	no, trust me, they're actual duncans

2016-04-26 23:25:11	&Leliana	nnng
2016-04-26 23:26:00	%DANtheBEASTman	.. I don't think you understand what duncan designed are.. Duncan licenses the designs to the guitar manufacturer. The manufacturer is then responsible for fabrication. This means that if the manufacturer wants to cut corners and order cheaper parts, they can because it is "duncan designed" not "duncan manufactured." This absolves SD of any warranty responsibility if the pickup is faulty etc,
2016-04-26 23:26:02	%DANtheBEASTman	because it wasn't made by their employees in their factory in Santa Barbra, it was made is a factory in Korea or China or the Philippines.
2016-04-26 23:27:32	%DANtheBEASTman	i'd personally go for a JB/Jazz setup

2016-05-05 16:01:11	TheSinding	Thanks Hexarei 
2016-05-05 16:01:22	volsa-	If I'd use i3 then it'd need to intialize a gap which respects the cusomized geometry for lemonbar
2016-05-05 16:01:35	_VexatioN	i3 gives a lot more configuration options then awesome 
2016-05-05 16:01:50	_VexatioN	also I'm pretty sure airgaps for i3 has different values for inner and outter gaps
2016-05-05 16:01:55	volsa-	that would mean a gap of 30 just for the top direction will give me a gap for left, right and the bottom
2016-05-05 16:02:10	volsa-	while you can declare the gaps for left, right, top and bottom in bspwm

2016-05-05 16:07:59	Hexarei	Someone should make that
2016-05-05 16:08:07	Hexarei	_VexatioN: we can call it waifu.io
2016-05-05 16:08:15	volsa-	If I am using i3 with a gap of 30 on my laptop screen, then i am going to waste so much space
2016-05-05 16:08:39	volsa-	bspwm doesnt do that and that's why I mainly switched from i3 to bspwm
2016-05-05 16:08:54	skr0tm	what I use a gab of 30 and thats just right
2016-05-05 16:09:13	Hexarei	Huh. I'm pretty sure i3-gaps _does_ support custom geometry in a bar. You just have to make sure it's the bar listed in your config, and you tell i3 how tall it is
2016-05-05 16:09:38	_VexatioN	Hexarei: I thought that was a real thing and tried to go there
2016-05-05 16:09:55	_VexatioN	Hexarei's right actually 
2016-05-05 16:10:04	Hexarei	> reads "we can call it" as "it's called"
2016-05-05 16:10:42	volsa-	skr0tm: I was giving an example
2016-05-05 16:11:04	volsa-	I most likely need a greater number than 50 (around 60 if not more I think)
2016-05-05 16:11:31	 *	Hexarei is tempted to try lemonbar just as a proof-of-concept
2016-05-05 16:12:47	volsa-	Hexarei: I'm not sure about that tbh. It will most likely support custom geometry for the i3bar but not lemonbar?
2016-05-05 16:13:13	Hexarei	Nope, you tell i3 how tall your bar is, and specify the command separately

2016-05-05 16:16:21	Hexarei	Is it just ~/.lemonbar?
2016-05-05 16:16:31	skr0tm	that calles lemonbar
2016-05-05 16:16:36	Hexarei	Ohhh, so I run that directly, instead of the lemonbar command
2016-05-05 16:16:38	Hexarei	understood
2016-05-05 16:16:45	skr0tm	so you need to install lemonbar and the script pipes info into it
2016-05-05 16:17:04	skr0tm	the workspaces is another bar with my current workspace
2016-05-05 16:17:42	Hexarei	hmm

2016-05-05 16:17:48	skr0tm	and I start it with this currently http://ix.io/AEw because I need to kill conky before changing the bg and kill lemonbar before restarting conky
2016-05-05 16:17:55	Hexarei	I'm apparently missing a font, got two invalid colors specified, and a missing python file
2016-05-05 16:17:55	skr0tm	not pretty but works for me
2016-05-05 16:18:10	skr0tm	Hexarei~ for what exactly?

2016-05-05 16:26:19	+Aigis	TheSinding doesn't have any desktops saved.
2016-05-05 16:27:12	skr0tm	Hexarei~ its called t . its nice, but I use a fork from antona
2016-05-05 16:27:23	Hexarei	I use taskwarrior
2016-05-05 16:28:19	skr0tm	taskwarrior has to much for me
2016-05-05 16:28:28	skr0tm	but well, you can pipe taskwarrior into the bar 
2016-05-05 16:28:35	volsa-	.git antona 
2016-05-05 16:28:35	+Aigis	[1] https://www.github.com/antonjah/dotfiles [antona]
2016-05-05 16:28:38	Hexarei	Has too much... in terms of feature set?
2016-05-05 16:30:10	skr0tm	yes I just want one command to make a new todo
2016-05-05 16:30:16	skr0tm	and a flag + id to delete it
2016-05-05 16:30:31	Hexarei	`task create [description]`
2016-05-05 16:30:37	Hexarei	`task delete [id]`
2016-05-05 16:30:44	Hexarei	That it?
2016-05-05 16:31:03	skr0tm	hu?
2016-05-05 16:31:13	Hexarei	That's creation/deletion of a task in taskwarrior
2016-05-05 16:31:18	skr0tm	okay
2016-05-05 16:31:25	skr0tm	ye dunno,i just stay on t
2016-05-05 16:32:05	Hexarei	sorry, it's actually `task add`
2016-05-05 16:32:28	skr0tm	but my bar is pretty specific I guess. there are nicer ones out with a bunch of features and scripts and clickable areas and shit
2016-05-05 16:32:46	skr0tm	mines just displays the only info I need 
2016-05-05 16:33:59	Hexarei	https://u.teknik.io/2806M.png
2016-05-05 16:34:45	Hexarei	(You can also do 'task 3 done' to mark it completed)
2016-05-05 16:35:02	Hexarei	Not trying to get you to switch, just clearing up any confusion you might have
2016-05-05 16:35:24	Hexarei	I like taskwarrior because it's powerful af, but still simple enough that you don't have to use all the tons of features
2016-05-05 16:36:24	skr0tm	thats the same pic again?
2016-05-05 16:37:21	Hexarei	huh?
2016-05-05 16:38:17	skr0tm	you just posted?
2016-05-05 16:38:27	skr0tm	im on 720p, I cant inspect those scrots :D
2016-05-05 16:39:56	Hexarei	???
2016-05-05 16:40:06	Hexarei	I posted a tiny scrot
2016-05-05 16:40:13	Hexarei	Of just a terminal
2016-05-05 16:40:20	Hexarei	dunno what you're seeing, but it ain't what I posted
2016-05-05 16:40:30	skr0tm	oh nvm my copy paste broke

2016-05-05 16:43:03	Hexarei	`alias t='task add'` would do the same to me
2016-05-05 16:43:11	skr0tm	i know ;)
2016-05-05 16:43:28	skr0tm	whatever, aslong as one actually looks at his toto lists
2016-05-05 16:43:36	Hexarei	indeed
2016-05-05 16:44:30	skr0tm	thats why I added it to my bar, cause Id never look at it otherwise

2016-05-05 16:52:01	_VexatioN	Hexarei: ;)
2016-05-05 16:54:04	skr0tm	_VexatioN~ lemonbar is not that hard
2016-05-05 16:54:14	Hexarei	Hmmm
2016-05-05 16:54:18	skr0tm	but you need to know any scripting language to pipe info into it
2016-05-05 16:54:41	Hexarei	It's also fairly dumb, does exactly what you tell it to and nothing more
2016-05-05 16:55:00	skr0tm	ye, spacing is really just... spaces
2016-05-05 16:55:24	Hexarei	Which means you'll have to script your own placement/sizing/multiple-instances if you're using it with i3. hrm
2016-05-05 16:56:03	Hexarei	in short, I think it skr0tm's config could definitely be done in i3. would it be easy? no. would the code be clean? probably not at all
2016-05-05 16:57:12	skr0tm	my config is on i3
2016-05-05 16:58:49	skr0tm	I dont get that sentence Hexarei :3

2016-05-05 17:01:55	Hexarei	hrm. not seeing lemonbar get started in your i3config
2016-05-05 17:02:33	volsa-	that font somewhat sucks, doesnt it?
2016-05-05 17:02:40	volsa-	I mean how do you code with it?
2016-05-05 17:04:10	skr0tm	Hexarei~ it doesnt, because I turn it of at times, so I just start it in the background by hand
2016-05-05 17:04:17	Hexarei	oh. ew
2016-05-05 17:04:19	skr0tm	volsa-~ no? its amazin for coding
2016-05-05 17:04:30	skr0tm	Hexarei~ I could tho If I wanted to
2016-05-05 17:04:47	Hexarei	What do you start it with? Just the lemonbar script? Or that 'workspaces.sh" script?
2016-05-05 17:05:09	Hexarei	And, more importantly... How do you get i3 to give it space?
2016-05-05 17:06:32	Hexarei	your config confuses and intimidates me
2016-05-05 17:06:47	skr0tm	http://ix.io/AEw with this, to change the bg randomly etc
2016-05-05 17:07:02	skr0tm	and a conky
2016-05-05 17:07:05	skr0tm	gives the space

2016-05-05 17:08:16	Hexarei	hmmm.. Why do you kill it every 2800 seconds?
2016-05-05 17:08:55	Hexarei	I repeat: your config confuses and intimidates me
2016-05-05 17:09:08	skr0tm	Hexarei~ its the most unorganized shit ever
2016-05-05 17:09:11	volsa-	Lynn you sexy beast. What font are you using for the first .dtop result?
2016-05-05 17:09:12	skr0tm	what part of it?
2016-05-05 17:09:28	Hexarei	skr0tm: yes.
2016-05-05 17:09:30	Hexarei	:-)
2016-05-05 17:09:35	skr0tm	haha
2016-05-05 17:09:45	mrskelltin	skr0tms git intimidates me and turns me on

2016-05-05 17:10:03	Hexarei	At this point, I just need to know why you're killing/restarting every 2800 seconds
2016-05-05 17:10:19	skr0tm	okay, i3 just does the i3 stuff, the script I just send you starts and randomizes backgrounds 
2016-05-05 17:10:59	Hexarei	Randomizes them... by killing/restarting conky & lemonbar every 2800 seconds?
2016-05-05 17:11:14	Hexarei	(I see feh in there as well, just confused as to why the other stuff)
2016-05-05 17:11:19	skr0tm	because I dont actually use compton atm because performance is an issue. so no real transperency. but if I change my bg conky keeps the old one cached. So I just kill it, kill lemonbars, change bg and start it both again
2016-05-05 17:11:31	Hexarei	oh
2016-05-05 17:11:41	skr0tm	I could ofc use compton, make a fullsize lemonbar with transparency
2016-05-05 17:11:56	skr0tm	which I would do if my laptop could take it without dying 
2016-05-05 17:12:02	<--	hozed has quit (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)

2016-05-05 17:12:23	skr0tm	so I do this dirty stuff. 
2016-05-05 17:13:04	skr0tm	and its not on a crontab, which would free up a subshell because I kill it at times to have more space
2016-05-05 17:13:24	skr0tm	its really tailored towards me with hacky workarounds and I would never tell anyone to use this bar
2016-05-05 17:13:34	skr0tm	well bbl
2016-05-05 17:13:39	Hexarei	heh
2016-05-05 17:14:03	skr0tm	well use the bar, just use it smarter
2016-05-05 17:14:14	skr0tm	the sh that pipes the info is okay imo

2016-05-05 18:44:33	Forkk	how's it going
2016-05-05 18:46:31	Hexarei	skr0tm: whew, lemonbar is hard to work with but I've scripted it to show up on every monitor now. working on getting it to resize when modify my gaps per-workspace
2016-05-05 18:46:58	Forkk	wonder if I could get taffybar to show up on all monitors
2016-05-05 18:47:02	Forkk	that would be nice
2016-05-05 18:47:26	jiaxsun	i should make my lemon bar appear on both monitors
2016-05-05 18:47:45	Hexarei	https://u.teknik.io/KJnkm.png
2016-05-05 18:47:52	Forkk	would I just have to run it twice
2016-05-05 18:48:24	Hexarei	I haven't even done any customization on the lemonbar yet, heh. just been trying to script it actually showing up everywhere
2016-05-05 18:48:26	TheSinding	What analytics tool is, it you are running Hexarei 
2016-05-05 18:48:52	Forkk	I don't use lemonbar, but how did you get it to do that Hexarei
2016-05-05 18:49:02	Forkk	maybe it can apply to taffybar too
2016-05-05 18:49:14	Forkk	did you just start an instance of it for each monitor
2016-05-05 18:49:21	skr0tm	Hexarei~ cool, what you scripting with? sh?
2016-05-05 18:49:26	Hexarei	TheSinding: It's a Grafana dashboard, pulling from a stats db somewhere
2016-05-05 18:49:39	Hexarei	skr0tm: yeah
2016-05-05 18:49:42	Hexarei	I'll post it in a moment
2016-05-05 18:50:08	Hexarei	Where should I paste it? dunno what all the kids are using these days for pastebinning
2016-05-05 18:50:18	Forkk	also, does lemonbar have a system tray thing?
2016-05-05 18:50:21	Forkk	Hexarei: git
2016-05-05 18:50:25	Forkk	er gist
2016-05-05 18:50:25	TheSinding	What the purpose of it? 
2016-05-05 18:50:39	TheSinding	Okay
2016-05-05 18:50:40	TheSinding	nvm
2016-05-05 18:50:41	Hexarei	Forkk: no clue
2016-05-05 18:50:46	TheSinding	its for the pc

2016-05-05 18:51:12	Forkk	what does that mean
2016-05-05 18:51:27	TheSinding	Arh okay, cool.. Render nodes? 
2016-05-05 18:51:57	Hexarei	Nope. web servers, microservice instances, and database instances
2016-05-05 18:52:08	Hexarei	"Viewer" is one of our apps
2016-05-05 18:52:24	TheSinding	Oh, nice..
2016-05-05 18:52:51	TheSinding	Its open source? 
2016-05-05 18:53:42	Forkk	oh man is lemonbar one of those where you have to write stuff to a named pipe to display it on the bar
2016-05-05 18:53:49	skr0tm	Hexarei~   cat $argv | curl -F 'f:1=<-' ix.io
2016-05-05 18:54:15	jiaxsun	NO

2016-05-05 18:54:26	jiaxsun	my god damn firefox just crashed while taking an exam
2016-05-05 18:54:39	Hexarei	jiaxsun: well that sucks
2016-05-05 18:54:51	Hexarei	no resume function?
2016-05-05 18:55:09	Forkk	tfw lemonbar has no tray support :(
2016-05-05 18:55:16	jiaxsun	i didn't save my answers but luckily the bubble just refilled themselves a few seconds after the page loaded :)
2016-05-05 18:55:35	skr0tm	Forkk~ lemonbar has whatever you want it to. you just have to write it yourself
2016-05-05 18:55:44	Hexarei	skr0tm: http://ix.io/AHw
2016-05-05 18:55:59	Hexarei	Built off of yours a bit
2016-05-05 18:56:03	Forkk	skr0tm: how do you add a tray to it by only writing strings to a named pipe
2016-05-05 18:56:07	jiaxsun	anyone know good softwareware to view powerpoints on linux?
2016-05-05 18:56:29	a-109-107	Forkk, how do you even begin adding tray support to lemonbar?
2016-05-05 18:56:42	Forkk	a-109-107: I don't know, that's what I'm asking
2016-05-05 18:56:51	Hexarei	invoked with "./lemonbar [outer_gaps] [inner_gaps] [border_width]"
2016-05-05 18:57:02	a-109-107	afaikit doesn't Forkk 
2016-05-05 18:57:28	skr0tm	Hexarei~ I just saw thats an older file before I pushed. but you already do that getting the current screen width so nbm
2016-05-05 18:57:30	skr0tm	looks good
2016-05-05 18:57:34	Forkk	It's fine, there are things like stalonetray specifically for this
2016-05-05 18:57:56	Forkk	plus I'm already stuck to taffybar which has a tray, so it's not my concern whether lemonbar does or not :P
2016-05-05 18:58:27	Forkk	looks like this config just spawns a bar for each monitor
2016-05-05 18:58:53	Forkk	I guess I could do that, but I'd have to add stuff to my multi-monitor script to automatically stop the second monitor's bar when I turn it off
2016-05-05 18:59:22	Hexarei	Forkk: it does, and I have i3's config set to restart anytime something changes(like the gap sizes or the number of monitors)
2016-05-05 18:59:24	Forkk	sounds like a good project for the morning :)
2016-05-05 19:01:32	Forkk	I really like the idea of writing to my bar with a bash script though tbh
2016-05-05 19:01:46	Forkk	it'd make it much easier to interop with compared to haskell
2016-05-05 19:01:55	Forkk	since most of my setup revolves around the shell
2016-05-05 19:02:07	Forkk	but the lack of tray support really kills it for me
2016-05-05 19:02:16	<--	Tortoise has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
2016-05-05 19:02:38	Forkk	plus taffybar has mouse controls which are the only way I can switch workspaces with my mouse
2016-05-05 19:02:53	Hexarei	you can do mouse controls in lemon
2016-05-05 19:02:58	Forkk	how
2016-05-05 19:03:11	Hexarei	I don't know yet, but I do know it's possible to do
2016-05-05 19:03:17	Forkk	hmm
2016-05-05 19:03:27	Forkk	I'll look into this
2016-05-05 19:03:58	Forkk	I could tie it in with my welcome script that alerts me when things like backup tasks fail
2016-05-05 19:04:16	Forkk	maybe show a little alert thing in the bar when something goes wrong

2016-05-05 19:07:08	a-109-107	either of you have lemonbar span only one of many monitors? I never could get that to work
2016-05-05 19:07:10	Forkk	they print commands to stdout when clicked

2016-05-05 19:07:58	Forkk	why does lemonbar span both monitors
2016-05-05 19:08:04	Forkk	that's silly behavior
2016-05-05 19:08:22	Hexarei	because it's dumb, you have to tell it what to do
2016-05-05 19:08:30	a-109-107	Forkk look at the S attribute

2016-05-05 23:33:35	&Leliana	volsa-: impossible to answer
2016-05-05 23:33:51	&Leliana	mysql does a lot of caching sqlite doesn't
2016-05-05 23:33:59	&Leliana	but you can totally misconfigure mysql to be slower, and most often it is
2016-05-05 23:34:19	&Leliana	you also have to account for sqlite not being a daemon ready to access at any given moment
2016-05-05 23:34:38	&Leliana	and it has shitty concurrency
2016-05-05 23:36:09	volsa-	Well I've been testing the MySQL and the SQLite Driver for Java (inb4 eww java) and inserting numbers from 1 to 1000 into tables from a normal statement to a prepared statement and a preparedstatment + batch gave me the result that SQLite take 3x the time of MySQL
2016-05-05 23:36:52	volsa-	And I can't explain why
2016-05-05 23:36:59	volsa-	I'll take your answere into account
2016-05-05 23:37:06	volsa-	but i better google a bit
2016-05-05 23:37:30	&lunarmage	well, it's not like PDO where both drivers are essentially the same but programmed to talk to a different thing
2016-05-05 23:37:42	&lunarmage	they're most likely separate drivers developed by separate people
2016-05-05 23:38:07	&Leliana	probably not

2016-05-19 23:04:34	IdecEddy	The image preview is an optional feature of the Gnome's file chooser dialog. It ahs to be enabled on a per-program basis (meaning that to use it in Firefox, Firefox developers have to enable it). This is because not every application has any need for picture previes (think about text editors, for instance).
2016-05-19 23:04:35	+LambdaComplex	IdecEddy: feature request was made in 2004
2016-05-19 23:04:40	IdecEddy	You should send feedback to Firefox developers and ask them to enable the picture preview.

2016-05-19 23:12:25	IdecEddy	when you upload here it just shows up on the server and people can save the file and not have to go to imgur and download it there 
2016-05-19 23:13:04	skr0tm	"remove a step" so its faster to click a dialouge, navigate to the image, click upload. isntead of fe in my case: mixup <path> . c-U . c . C-s-v
2016-05-19 23:14:13	IdecEddy	yes when you dont know the path to the image bacuse most of the time you get your dank memes from 4chan and dont have the setting to save original file names on

2016-05-19 23:14:51	%DANtheBEASTman	in my tekup script, the thing that uploads to teknik is  curl -F "contentType=${mime}" -F "file=@${file}" https://api.teknik.io/v1/Upload

2016-05-19 23:16:38	skr0tm	but teknik is slow af
2016-05-19 23:16:53	%DANtheBEASTman	hm. strange. it uploads p fast for me
2016-05-19 23:17:08	skr0tm	yes, the upload is okay, not much difference to mixtape
2016-05-19 23:17:15	IdecEddy	I need to rebuild the image uploading part of my website. 
2016-05-19 23:17:18	skr0tm	but I dont want it to be a pain for the people viewing
2016-05-19 23:17:30	skr0tm	IdecEddy~ what are you currently doing?
2016-05-19 23:17:59	IdecEddy	just posting it to my image board and putting that link :p

2016-05-19 23:19:15	skr0tm	nah code wise
2016-05-19 23:19:33	skr0tm	many ways to handle files in php
2016-05-19 23:21:45	skr0tm	and you could make a simple script to curl to your own server to upload. and enabling your backend to handle the files would be easy too
2016-05-19 23:23:24	%DANtheBEASTman	i've never really been into python, but holy shit ptpython is fucking amazing
2016-05-19 23:23:38	%DANtheBEASTman	i wish all repls were like this
2016-05-19 23:23:49	IdecEddy	I build a function named save() that runs some cheks moves the file from temp to a file where i have all my files rename it after a unix timestamp and add the path and some info about the image into msql 
2016-05-19 23:24:03	%DANtheBEASTman	lunarmage: you're into python now  pip install ptpython
2016-05-19 23:24:27	skr0tm	IdecEddy~ yeah so pretty standard 
2016-05-19 23:24:38	skr0tm	DANtheBEASTman~ and thats the reason I dont get why anyone does nodejs
2016-05-19 23:25:20	%DANtheBEASTman	because prototypical inheritance is pretty fucking powerful
2016-05-19 23:25:33	%DANtheBEASTman	and also first class functions
2016-05-19 23:26:06	skr0tm	ofc it is. node is overall very powerfull. but the debugging process is just the purest form of pain and hate

2016-05-23 13:56:17	&Leliana	source: I've seen it
2016-05-23 13:56:28	@Lynn	Friendly  reminder npm takes twice the amount of time to install when you don't disable the loading bar.
2016-05-23 13:57:18	gant	npm is trash
2016-05-23 13:57:20	gant	agreed

2016-05-23 13:59:11	@Lynn	Gotta stay hip
2016-05-23 13:59:11	gant	npm is slow with progress on because it has promise waitlocks to be able to show progress
2016-05-23 13:59:21	cosarara	I don't like it when language package managers want to install system utilities, in general. It's fine for project dependencies, but whenever I read "to install this program do <gem|npm|pip> whatever" I back away
2016-05-23 13:59:22	gant	also only affects parallel usage
2016-05-23 13:59:28	&Leliana	everything about npm just screams "fuck doing what everyone else has proven to work, we're javascript devs"
2016-05-23 13:59:43	gant	newsflash, you can npm i cli-package
2016-05-23 13:59:50	gant	and run it from node_modules/.bin
2016-05-23 14:00:01	gant	which is automatically in path for npm run-script btw
2016-05-23 14:00:12	gant	so you don't even need to use that path for your tasks
2016-05-23 14:00:33	@Lynn	cosarara: cabal, cargo, composer 
2016-05-23 14:00:37	@Lynn	You must back away a lot.
2016-05-23 14:00:37	gant	a lot of cli packages are simply launching their own local versions

2016-05-23 14:12:07	gant	they don't bump versions and just cherrypick security patches
2016-05-23 14:12:35	gant	they should just use new LTS versions here though as long as Argon is supported (which is not as long as the release cycle)
2016-05-23 14:12:45	gant	because all LTS gets is security fixes
2016-05-23 14:13:23	&Leliana	did you not read what I posted?
2016-05-23 14:13:27	gant	so what debian usually does is already being done

2016-05-23 14:13:47	&Leliana	whether that's done by debian or the nodejs maintainers, somone still has to package it

2016-05-23 15:31:01	onodera	since many tor nodes and devs are there
2016-05-23 15:31:16	skr0tm	I think because its the other way around :^)

2016-05-24 20:13:09	Algernon	stupid question, I'm new to Arch.
2016-05-24 20:13:20	Algernon	Where's the default windowmanager set to launch?
2016-05-24 20:13:26	Khorne	Autostart
2016-05-24 20:13:34	Khorne	Just copy the .lnk there
2016-05-24 20:13:36	hozed	there is no default window manager
2016-05-24 20:13:39	Darkwater	depends on how you install x
2016-05-24 20:13:45	Algernon	fuck
2016-05-24 20:13:45	Darkwater	/use it
2016-05-24 20:13:56	Algernon	so how do I change what Arch decides to execute upon login
2016-05-24 20:14:00	Algernon	Autostart?
2016-05-24 20:14:01	Khorne	Depends
2016-05-24 20:14:04	Khorne	On what you want
2016-05-24 20:14:06	hozed	prob xinit
2016-05-24 20:14:09	Khorne	xinitrc, Login Manager
2016-05-24 20:14:17	@kyubiko	you can change your shell which is the first program run on login from a tty
2016-05-24 20:14:21	Algernon	I have xinit installed.
2016-05-24 20:14:28	Khorne	Write a .xinitrc
2016-05-24 20:14:30	@kyubiko	you can add something to your shell rc to start something when that shell starts
2016-05-24 20:14:38	Khorne	kyubiko, wat
2016-05-24 20:14:38	@kyubiko	you can write an xinitrc to start stuff when x starts
2016-05-24 20:14:47	surreal	.nig_rc
2016-05-24 20:14:50	Khorne	Thats not what you want to do to launch a de
2016-05-24 20:14:52	Khorne	or wm
2016-05-24 20:15:03	Darkwater	you can also use a display manager like lightdm or a complete package like kde
2016-05-24 20:15:04	@kyubiko	oh I didn't know we were talking about DE
2016-05-24 20:15:04	surreal	bash has a startup rc

2016-05-24 20:15:16	@kyubiko	which has quite a lot of interpretations
2016-05-24 20:15:19	Khorne	true
2016-05-24 20:15:30	Darkwater	my pc automatically logs me in on tty1, and whenever I log in on tty1 it runs startx
2016-05-24 20:15:48	Darkwater	which, as defined in my .xinitrc, execs bspwm
2016-05-24 20:15:54	surreal	well. that's assuming a lot. why would anyone want to start x?
2016-05-24 20:15:57	surreal	fucking pretense.

2016-05-24 20:31:06	hozed	well i did drop a RTFM on you lol
2016-05-24 20:31:08	Algernon	Awesome seemed to boot up fine and I was forced to login(reset conf).
2016-05-24 20:31:15	porkslapchop	Waypop: there is lot of gnome packages in unity which have been modified or held back.the whole distro seemed like a huge clusterfuck. Errormessages everywhere and repohunting wasnt fun aswell.
2016-05-24 20:31:16	Algernon	Understandable.
2016-05-24 20:31:18	hozed	but its no prob
2016-05-24 20:31:20	Algernon	I shouldn't be on Arch.
2016-05-24 20:31:24	Algernon	I should be on Debian.
2016-05-24 20:31:31	porkslapchop	I dont know if modified is the right word though
2016-05-24 20:31:34	Algernon	But I kinda wanted to try it out.

2016-05-24 20:32:00	Algernon	I've used Bloatbuntu and use it at work because we use precompiled binaries to save dev time

2016-05-24 20:32:19	Algernon	Which if I'm not mistaken was just Debian with Openbox and some nice startup scripts.

2016-05-24 20:46:32	Waypop	there isn't really many reasons to go outside of it, and if you do it's usually to official developer repos

2016-05-24 20:46:49	porkslapchop	What I dont get is people who use "meme" distros

2016-05-24 21:42:45	hozed	all a seedbox is, is a torrent client like transmission or rtorrent that you run on a server
2016-05-24 21:42:50	Algernon	Right
2016-05-24 21:43:04	hozed	install transmission, boom seedbox
2016-05-24 21:43:04	Algernon	but do people generally use them to seed the shit out of the torrent they're downloading on their pc?
2016-05-24 21:43:32	hozed	if theyre part of  private trackers then yes
2016-05-24 21:43:45	Algernon	Why only private?

2016-05-24 21:43:54	Algernon	I just got a What.cd invite but just wondering.

2016-05-24 21:44:21	surreal	private trackers seems like a really retarded way of feeling important
2016-05-24 21:44:49	hozed	ya seedbox isnt a bad idea, you can host one locally or buy a vps and throw one together

2016-05-24 21:46:05	Algernon	I downloaded a Streetlight album from KAT and got a letter three days later.
2016-05-24 21:46:20	hozed	that wont happen on private sites though
2016-05-24 21:46:35	hozed	because their is no one sending dmca's to your isp
2016-05-24 21:46:45	Algernon	No one sends dmcas to Google.
2016-05-24 21:46:51	Algernon	well I'm sure they do.
2016-05-24 21:46:57	Algernon	But I doubt I got dmca'd off a 400mb torrent.
2016-05-24 21:47:03	Algernon	It's an automated system, apparently. 
2016-05-24 21:47:08	Algernon	They really don't like torrents.
2016-05-24 21:47:13	Algernon	Of any kind as far as I can tell.
2016-05-24 21:47:48	hozed	depending what torrent it was, thats usually how it works, mpaa monitors public swarms
2016-05-24 21:48:06	hozed	but maybe google is being a torrent cop
2016-05-24 21:48:35	surreal	google allows piracy to exist in the form of youtube so they get ad money
2016-05-24 21:48:56	hozed	good point
2016-05-24 21:49:03	surreal	this is why i only pirate open-source vaporwave
2016-05-24 21:49:14	Algernon	My workplace also got a letter because someone torrented some shit on the work's network.

2016-05-24 21:50:27	surreal	i only like a few artists and i just stream animu
2016-05-24 21:50:32	surreal	so /shrugs/
2016-05-24 21:50:43	hozed	what happens is dmca notices get sent to your isp and your isp forwards them on to you
2016-05-24 21:50:44	Algernon	Nujabes is good if you don't already listen to him.
2016-05-24 21:50:48	Algernon	I know.
2016-05-24 21:51:04	Algernon	But it seems that Google has some system setup to automatically cuck people torrenting shit.
2016-05-24 21:51:17	hozed	but in private sites it shouldnt happen, unless google is monitoring your traffic which would be highly suspicious
2016-05-24 21:51:30	Algernon	I'll tell you by Monday.
2016-05-24 21:51:38	Algernon	got my what.cd invite, I'll try an album or something.

2016-05-24 21:52:51	Algernon	Oh fuck me
2016-05-24 21:52:55	Algernon	Seedboxes are sick as fuck

2016-05-24 22:12:02	+LambdaComplex	hozed: that was a pretty obvious shitpost tbh
2016-05-24 22:12:05	+LambdaComplex	but i'm enjoying this
2016-05-24 22:12:05	hozed	lisp doesnt have any quirks though
2016-05-24 22:12:20	+LambdaComplex	Also I should point out that my pointing-out is being _very_ polite
2016-05-24 22:12:36	%DANtheBEASTman	hozed: except for the fact there is no such thing as a lisp language, there's just various incompatible dialects
2016-05-24 22:12:40	+LambdaComplex	The actual method is more along the lines of "Holy fucking shit I told you to put it in double quotes and yet you're still asking about it why are you such an idiot"
2016-05-24 22:12:52	+LambdaComplex	--greycat in #bash every day, basically
2016-05-24 22:13:23	%DANtheBEASTman	i mean in fairness he probably gets 500 people a day who don't understand quoting rules and have never even opened `man bash`
2016-05-24 22:13:53	+LambdaComplex	In fairness, bash's manpage is fucking gigantic
2016-05-24 22:13:54	hozed	how is lisp not a language
2016-05-24 22:13:59	+LambdaComplex	But yeah you're right
2016-05-24 22:14:09	+LambdaComplex	hozed: because it's a spec, not a language
2016-05-24 22:14:12	+LambdaComplex	hozed: languages implement the spec

2016-05-24 22:14:59	IdecEddy	should I put GNU/Linux or just Linux on my resume? 
2016-05-24 22:14:59	+LambdaComplex	Although doesn't that mean C really isn't a language either?
2016-05-24 22:15:07	mitya	wat
2016-05-24 22:15:19	%DANtheBEASTman	no because C is itself a language.
2016-05-24 22:15:23	hozed	i could have swore lisp was a language
2016-05-24 22:15:30	+LambdaComplex	C99 vs GNU C vs etc?

2016-05-24 22:15:52	mitya	fortran just looks like pseudocode
2016-05-24 22:16:01	+LambdaComplex	IdecEddy: That's a good question
2016-05-24 22:16:21	hozed	what company is it
2016-05-24 22:16:21	+LambdaComplex	IdecEddy: I wanna go with the first option, but I feel like that implies you'd be incapable of using other coreutil implementations (which is probably inaccurate)
2016-05-24 22:16:35	%DANtheBEASTman	hozed: lisp is a family of languages. there's no actual lisp language. there's common lisp, scheme, guile, racket, and several dozen others.
2016-05-24 22:16:40	+LambdaComplex	I'm thinking maybe "Linux and other Unix-like operating systems?"
2016-05-24 22:16:48	+LambdaComplex	Considering you'd probably be fine with, say, BSD as well
2016-05-24 22:17:11	+LambdaComplex	Then again whoever reads it is probably gonna be a normie so maybe "Linux" by itself is the best choice

2016-05-24 22:17:59	IdecEddy	hahah 
2016-05-24 22:18:10	+LambdaComplex	basically there's no right answer, only lots of wrong answers :^D
2016-05-24 22:18:18	%DANtheBEASTman	personally i'd put GNU+Linux since I really only have experience with GNU and have never used BSD
2016-05-24 22:18:29	IdecEddy	if someone asked me if i was a kernel hacker id tell them i code in HTML/CSS 
2016-05-24 22:18:38	%DANtheBEASTman	best answer

2016-05-24 22:20:58	hozed	could also just say unix like operating systems

2016-05-24 22:47:52	skr0tm	okay shining might be the better kubrick movie. just because the girl was so scared of Nicholson after being practicly under psychological turture from kubrick and had to go to psych after wards.
2016-05-24 22:48:05	skr0tm	she was legitmitly scared shitless in the bathroom scene

2016-05-25 00:07:38	cflag	if it was compiled for windows ya
2016-05-25 00:08:26	porkslapchop	i just used chocolatey to install it.
2016-05-25 00:08:35	porkslapchop	such a dirty method of installing programs tbh
2016-05-25 00:09:00	cflag	Compiling?
2016-05-25 00:09:39	hozed	no windows cheating
2016-05-25 00:10:00	hozed	trying to make windows into something its not
2016-05-25 00:11:07	hozed	its like wine and linux, its just not always pretty
2016-05-25 00:15:53	porkslapchop	its slightly better than the alternative
2016-05-25 00:18:46	%DANtheBEASTman	chocolatey is one of the few things that makes windows usable
2016-05-25 00:19:54	hozed	i just hate windows i guess. It supports DRM and locked systems and is now selling uses data for advertising
2016-05-25 00:20:06	hozed	users*
2016-05-25 00:20:18	sweglorde	i love how windows users in r/pcmasterrace shit on macs when now windows is worse
2016-05-25 00:21:33	hozed	neither are any better than the other. both of which are locked systems preventing the user from truly owning their device
2016-05-25 00:21:59	sweglorde	i think osx is a little better since it actually gives you root access and is a real unix
2016-05-25 00:22:19	sweglorde	windows literally tricks you into installing their software
2016-05-25 00:22:24	sweglorde	and plasters ads on your desktop
2016-05-25 00:22:39	Darkwater	as a linux user i'd rather use osx than windows
2016-05-25 00:22:46	Darkwater	oh yeah ads
2016-05-25 00:23:05	hozed	osx is not open nor is it free software
2016-05-25 00:23:17	Darkwater	yesterday i was playing tf2 when suddenly a 'notification' "download office 365" or something
2016-05-25 00:23:21	sweglorde	neither is windows
2016-05-25 00:23:26	onodera	tfw my head auto translates senpai for fam
2016-05-25 00:23:29	hozed	exactly my point
2016-05-25 00:23:33	onodera	s/for/to
2016-05-25 00:23:42	sweglorde	both of them are bad but they aren't equally bad
2016-05-25 00:24:01	Darkwater	i've used osx for a while actually, around 10.5
2016-05-25 00:24:27	hozed	also being able to get root in mac is the same as running the command prompt as an administrator in windows
2016-05-25 00:26:09	sweglorde	even as an administrator i think windows is more restrictive
2016-05-25 00:26:27	sweglorde	also OSX uses bash so you know exactly what commands you are doing
2016-05-25 00:27:44	sweglorde	nvm just noticed that powershell is open
2016-05-25 00:28:08	sweglorde	tho cmd and powershell are pretty trash
2016-05-25 00:28:15	hozed	but what it comes down to is that apple develops proprietary software
2016-05-25 00:28:42	sweglorde	apple has also released open source software
2016-05-25 00:29:10	hozed	and that doesnt make it any better. the only reason theyve realeased anything open was because it made developing easier for them
2016-05-25 00:29:20	hozed	they are a major supporter of DRM
2016-05-25 00:30:08	porkslapchop	how dependant is osx on an apple id btw?
2016-05-25 00:30:09	torikaji	OSX is pretty okay when you use homebrew (google analytics aside)
2016-05-25 00:30:18	mrskelltin	administrator used to mean  " root" up to win7/8. 
2016-05-25 00:30:18	mrskelltin	As of 10, there are all sorts of things i cant do even as "administrator".
2016-05-25 00:30:18	mrskelltin	On el capitan, i still truly am root and can do whatever the heck i want,
2016-05-25 00:30:29	porkslapchop	I know literally nothing about osx other than that I think that it looks neat.
2016-05-25 00:30:36	sweglorde	also we're not comparing OSX to linux, we're comparing it to windows
2016-05-25 00:30:44	torikaji	porkslapchop: not terrible dependant 
2016-05-25 00:30:50	hozed	its never ok to restrict the user who pays thousands for your product to not even be able to do what they will with their software
2016-05-25 00:30:51	mrskelltin	osx is comfy as hell tbh. i get the fanboyism.
2016-05-25 00:30:52	torikaji	it's only if you want to use iCloud, etc
2016-05-25 00:31:13	porkslapchop	I used windows almost all my life. it just is bad. the more I learnt about computers the more I hated windows.
2016-05-25 00:31:17	hozed	ya its similar to google and android in the sense that if you dont want to use it you dont have to
2016-05-25 00:31:30	hozed	porkslapchop: same here
2016-05-25 00:31:50	hozed	the more i learned the more mad i got
2016-05-25 00:32:00	porkslapchop	we need a group of super rich guys to create bounties for the advancement of free software ^^
2016-05-25 00:32:00	sweglorde	osx is a nice little OS but I would personally never use their hardware
2016-05-25 00:32:18	sweglorde	porkslapchop: this
2016-05-25 00:32:28	mrskelltin	iterm2 is fantastic. everything seems to just work without being finicky. Ive been trying to use urxvt but its such a pain after iterm
2016-05-25 00:32:36	hozed	thats what the FSF does
2016-05-25 00:32:38	porkslapchop	I mean I'm poor as fuck and even I donate occasionally
2016-05-25 00:32:40	torikaji	iterm2 is comfy as hell, that's for sure
2016-05-25 00:32:43	hozed	we3ll their not rich
2016-05-25 00:32:47	torikaji	using it right now, haha
2016-05-25 00:33:08	sweglorde	bill gates would totally do that if he werent tackling actual world problems
2016-05-25 00:33:08	porkslapchop	the fsf is hilariously understaffed
2016-05-25 00:33:17	hozed	13 employees
2016-05-25 00:33:38	porkslapchop	roomie has some connections to them. I think whole eu fsf has one small office
2016-05-25 00:33:43	hozed	their a non profit though so i think the rely on voulenteers alot too
2016-05-25 00:33:43	sweglorde	im pretty sure bill gates is oblivious to the nasty tactics the people in charge of MS are doing
2016-05-25 00:33:58	mrskelltin	im going to dtop how comfy my current osx is tonight. its in such better shape than my arch 
2016-05-25 00:34:24	porkslapchop	The problem is there are so many autists so it does not get recognized. They need truly good pr.
2016-05-25 00:34:36	porkslapchop	mrskelltin. do that pls
2016-05-25 00:34:38	mrskelltin	even my wm, im finding more useful than i3 (i know, heresy)
2016-05-25 00:34:46	sweglorde	there was that one linux commercial during the superbowl that one time
2016-05-25 00:34:58	mrskelltin	the terrifying one from ibm?
2016-05-25 00:34:59	hozed	prob redhat or some shit
2016-05-25 00:35:05	sweglorde	but it literally just had some cool stock footage and the words "linux" 
2016-05-25 00:35:05	torikaji	mrskelltin: not using aqua?
2016-05-25 00:35:22	-->	R0b0t1 has joined #rice

2016-05-25 00:38:01	torikaji	is linux
2016-05-25 00:38:08	sweglorde	its a great commercial but it doesnt tell anything about linux unless you know the contect
2016-05-25 00:38:14	@Tomoko_A_Best	cool commercial
2016-05-25 00:38:17	sweglorde	it was probably forgotten about by most viewers in 30 seconds
2016-05-25 00:38:19	hozed	it was from linux foundation
2016-05-25 00:39:01	hozed	no one prob knew wtf the purpose of it was
2016-05-25 00:39:07	torikaji	Linus Torvalds: Why Choose a Career in Linux and Open Source 
2016-05-25 00:39:08	hozed	i dont even get it
2016-05-25 00:39:33	sweglorde	yeah
2016-05-25 00:39:41	sweglorde	tho at the time things like ubuntu werent a big thing
2016-05-25 00:40:05	sweglorde	if it happened now with mint(if it were more professional) or ubuntu it would do really good
2016-05-25 00:40:06	porkslapchop	If I buy a raspberry(or something similiar) Do i have to buy extra powersupply
2016-05-25 00:40:11	torikaji	yeah
2016-05-25 00:40:21	porkslapchop	damn
2016-05-25 00:40:22	torikaji	use your phone charger
2016-05-25 00:40:25	sweglorde	doesnt the raspi run off of an android charger?
2016-05-25 00:40:36	sweglorde	my B+ does, idk about the newer models
2016-05-25 00:40:55	porkslapchop	well it needs to be stable. gonna use it as a mediacenter for my dad
2016-05-25 00:41:00	hozed	ya same cable you mean
2016-05-25 00:41:11	torikaji	5 volt powersupply with micro usb are the only requirements
2016-05-25 00:41:18	porkslapchop	oh nice.
2016-05-25 00:41:21	sweglorde	yeah
2016-05-25 00:41:28	sweglorde	the chargers they give you are marked up and shit
2016-05-25 00:41:34	sweglorde	so just use a cheap android charger
2016-05-25 00:41:37	hozed	the charger itself is 5v 1.5a i think
2016-05-25 00:41:49	torikaji	I think you can use the output from a computer via USB as well
2016-05-25 00:41:50	porkslapchop	btw i never understood the /g/ threads where they tell awful techstories about their family members
2016-05-25 00:41:54	hozed	underpowering a pi can damage it
2016-05-25 00:42:13	LeDZeP	Tomoko_A_Best: yes
2016-05-25 00:42:16	sweglorde	underpowering?
2016-05-25 00:42:21	sweglorde	how would that damage it?
2016-05-25 00:42:32	LeDZeP	Tomoko_A_Best: they added ak74u and m40a3 from cod4, and peacekeeper from bo2
2016-05-25 00:42:33	hozed	ya because of the voltage drop i think. i think the 1.5a is important. 
2016-05-25 00:42:37	sweglorde	o
2016-05-25 00:42:43	hozed	i could be wrong
2016-05-25 00:42:59	torikaji	I've seen warnings against it as well
2016-05-25 00:43:07	sweglorde	o
2016-05-25 00:43:08	torikaji	but the things so damn cheap it doesn't really matter
2016-05-25 00:43:17	hozed	ya true
2016-05-25 00:43:20	sweglorde	yeah p much
2016-05-25 00:43:20	torikaji	unless you want the pi zero kek
2016-05-25 00:43:27	porkslapchop	now I just need to find a tracker which has german synchronized series and movies :D
2016-05-25 00:43:30	sweglorde	tho if its gonna be a media center you wouldnt want it dying
2016-05-25 00:43:39	sweglorde	i would just build a cheap HTPC or something
2016-05-25 00:43:59	hozed	also dont waste your money on it for an HTPC unless its pi 3
2016-05-25 00:44:01	sweglorde	it would probably cost closer to $100 but it would live a lot longer than a pi
2016-05-25 00:44:02	porkslapchop	well its gonna be a birthday gift so 100 euros max
2016-05-25 00:44:10	torikaji	I have one running samba tbh
2016-05-25 00:44:17	hozed	the pi 2 is severely under powered
2016-05-25 00:44:19	torikaji	works fine through ethernet, wifi is too slow for it
2016-05-25 00:44:19	hozed	me too
2016-05-25 00:44:31	porkslapchop	it just needs to run kodi with a couple of addons
2016-05-25 00:44:37	torikaji	should be good
2016-05-25 00:44:38	@Tomoko_A_Best	LeDZeP: I'll be right on
2016-05-25 00:44:41	torikaji	especially the newer ones
2016-05-25 00:44:42	@Tomoko_A_Best	let me boot windows
2016-05-25 00:44:43	hozed	it works ok until i start watching HD movie and pausing makes it lag and freeze
2016-05-25 00:44:49	torikaji	I still have the 1st edition
2016-05-25 00:44:50	LeDZeP	Tomoko_A_Best: r-right now?
2016-05-25 00:44:59	LeDZeP	I'm gonna watch a 10 minute vid
2016-05-25 00:45:01	@Tomoko_A_Best	LeDZeP: ok
2016-05-25 00:45:03	@Tomoko_A_Best	I'll wait
