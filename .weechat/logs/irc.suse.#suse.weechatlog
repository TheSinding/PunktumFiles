2016-05-20 15:42:18	thesinding	Hey man
2016-05-20 15:43:28	thesinding	Im thinking about changing from arch to suse.. But, how easy would it be compiling something from debian to suse? 
2016-05-20 15:44:11	ascii-soup	Compiling or packaging?
2016-05-20 15:44:29	-->	marita__ has joined #suse
2016-05-20 15:45:00	thesinding	i need the displaylink drivers, that is for ubuntu and put it on opensuse
2016-05-20 15:45:26	}ls{	As easy as it is to "compile *SUSE for debian"? openSUSE Buildservice does this for numerous operating systems. An User does not need this.
2016-05-20 15:45:28	thesinding	I have no idea, wheather or not its compiling of packaging.
2016-05-20 15:45:38	thesinding	pretty sure its compiling
2016-05-20 15:45:50	ascii-soup	Do you have source?
2016-05-20 15:46:35	thesinding	yae
2016-05-20 15:46:59	ascii-soup	It should be fairly straightforward then, barring any weirdness in the driver itself

2016-05-20 15:48:52	ascii-soup	Open Build Service is like a giant hosted compiling/packaging farm
2016-05-20 15:49:11	}ls{	i doubt that you really need "displaylink drivers from Ubuntu"
2016-05-20 15:49:21	}ls{	why do you want this?
2016-05-20 15:49:23	ascii-soup	You can sign up for a free account and have the OBS compile and package source code for you against numerous different operating systems and architectures - it's pretty fantastic
2016-05-20 15:49:32	thesinding	I have a displaylink device

2016-05-20 15:58:53	}ls{	can't get it. How is this related to displaylink?
2016-05-20 15:59:28	}ls{	if you want to solve the issue with displaylink, poste info. See command above
2016-05-20 15:59:38	ascii-soup	thesinding isn't currently at the PC that has the DisplayLink, so the output of 'lsusb' cannot be obtained right now
2016-05-20 16:00:01	}ls{	ah. bad. stupid me.
2016-05-20 16:00:02	thesinding	I want to know how easy it would be to port it to opensuse
2016-05-20 16:00:06	thesinding	:) 
2016-05-20 16:00:26	ascii-soup	thesinding it's worth reading the thread that Sauerland posted above ^^
2016-05-20 16:00:26	}ls{	thesinding: it depends. 8)

2016-05-20 16:00:45	thesinding	Yeah, im doing that :) 
2016-05-20 16:01:20	thesinding	But they recently updated the drivers, to the newest kernel (the newest ubuntu kernel i belive) 
2016-05-20 16:01:21	ascii-soup	:-)
2016-05-20 16:02:03	ascii-soup	In theory at least, you should be fine - it looks like there's some source and a couple of firmware blobs and a *.run script that handles compiling it all etc

2016-05-20 16:02:17	ascii-soup	However, from that thread, it seems like people have been having some difficulties with it, so no guarantees

2016-05-20 16:03:16	ascii-soup	I guess if it was me, I'd try and get my hands on a blank hard drive, disconnect my current one (with working Ubuntu install), install new hard drive and install OpenSUSE, try getting the drivers to work
2016-05-20 16:03:31	ascii-soup	If it works, great, you can do that on your existing HDD, if not, at least you have your whole system still working on the other HDD
